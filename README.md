# AmazonEnhancer
AmazonEnhancer is a webextension for improving your Amazon experience. It was designed with the philosophy of making Amazon easier to read and quicker to load, with less unnecessary information in your face. My own experience with browsing Amazon was a cluttered and sometimes overbearing website which lead me to develop the extension.

As a company Amazon is interested in selling you as much product as they can, and so advertisements and links to other products are constant. AmazonEnhancer enables you to browse Amazon and see relevant information, but nothing beyond that which might lure you into unnecessary purchases or take up cognitive load. It also features some cool themes if you prefer darker or night time backgrounds.
